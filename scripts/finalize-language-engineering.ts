Older task definitions and learner data are retained. The review ledger still has zero real approvals.\n\nThis release adds exact assessment-context checks, task-definition binding for FSRS, preserved import of completed curriculum reviews, compiled human-review scopes and immediate refresh of saved responses. It also adds private-probe validation and study reporting with actual timing, original audio, missing follow-ups and explicit opportunity counts. A bare approval flag cannot qualify a study response.\n\nThe [HTML roadmap](LANGUAGE-AUTOMATICITY-ROADMAP.html) shows green engineering evidence separately from remaining human validation. The [human handoff](AUTOMATICITY-HUMAN-VALIDATION-HANDOFF.md) gives the exact next steps and commands.\n\nNo CEFR level, automatic grammar mastery, learner improvement or causal benefit is claimed.
